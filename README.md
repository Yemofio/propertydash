# MEND group - PropertyDash - E-commerce final team project

Project description:
Property Dash is an online business offering speed, detail, and credibility to owning property or accommodation. We are middlemen and more, providing the comfort of ease of property search.


Credits:
This project is intended for education purposes. As students, we pooled resources and looked into legacy projects that covered a similar business idea. As such, in the case our work shares similarities with other project online, we want to vehemently state that we do not take full credit or assume all concepts applied in the project are originally from the developing team.
